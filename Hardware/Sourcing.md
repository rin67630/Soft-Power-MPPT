# Sourcing 

this file is given for convenience. I am not affiliated in any way with AliExpress, and do not even recommend them, but they have enough choice to be able to sell almost anything I have been using. Many items sell by quantities. If you are not tinkering a lot, you are probably better off buying locally just what you need.
